## How it Works ?
Eco-Meter is a flutter app that gives user challenge by gamifying sustainability.The water,electricty and cooking gas usage is collected from user and compared with the average usage of the locality and given a token if it is less than the average,else given task to plant a tree if they exceed the average. There will be leaderboard according to the number of tokens earned,to make a healthy competition and create a sense of conscience that leads to a collective effort to reduce the usage.The app is completely built using flutter and firebase as backend. A chatbot is integrated to help users with information on ways to reduce the usage , it is built using openai Api.
